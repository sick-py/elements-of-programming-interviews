    Let A be the array and n its length. If we allow ourselves 0(n) additional space, we can solve the problem by iterating through A and recording values that have not appeared previously into a hash table. (The hash table is used to determine if a value is new.) New values are also written to a list. The list is then copied back into A.

    Here is a brute-force algorithm that uses 0(1) additional spaceâ€”iterate through A, testing if A[i] equals A[i + 1], and, if so, shift all elements at and after i + 2 to the left byone. When all entries are equal,the number of shiftsis(n-1)+(n-2)H 1-2+1, i.e., 0(n2), where n is the length of the array.
