    /**A singly linked list is a data structure that contains a sequence of nodes such that each node contains an object and a reference to the next node in the list.
     * The first node is referred to as the head and the last node is referred to as the tail; the tail's next field is null.
     * The structure of a singly linked list is given in Figure 8.1. There are many variants of linked lists, e.g., in a doubly linked list, each node has a link to its predecessor; similarly, a sentinel node or a self-loop can be used instead of null.
