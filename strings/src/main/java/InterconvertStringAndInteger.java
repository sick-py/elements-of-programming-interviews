    /**
     * Let's consider the integer to string problem first. If the number to convert is a single digit, i.e., it is between 0 and 9, the result is easy to compute: it is the string consisting of the single character encoding that digit.
     * If the number has more than one digit, it is natural to perform the conversion digit-by-digit. The key insight is that for any positive integer x, the least significant digit in the decimal representation of x is x mod 10, and the remaining digits are x/10.
     *  However, adding a digit to the beginning of a string is expensive, since all remaining digit have to be moved. A more time efficient approach is to add each computed digit to the end, and then reverse the computed sequence.
     * If x is negative, we record that, negate x,and then add a before reversing. If x is 0, our code breaks out of the iteration without writing any digits, in which case we need to explicitly set a 0
     * To convert from a string to an integer we recall the basic working of a positional number system. A base-10 number d2did0 encodes the number 102 xd2 + 101 X d\ + d0. A brute-force algorithm then is to begin with the rightmost digit, and iteratively add 10' X di to a cumulative sum. The efficient way to compute 10,+1 is to use the existing value 10' and multiply that by 10.
     * A more elegant solution is to begin from the leftmost digit and with each succeedÂ¬ ing digit, multiply the partial result by 10 and add that digit.
